The task at hand is a binary classification problem, for which both the training and the validation data sets are provided as csv files. We would like you to explore both data sets, note down your key observations along with a short summary / visualization and work on this classification task by building a classifier only with the training data, with the goal of achieving the best performance possible on the validation data. You are allowed to manipulate / remove any independent variables in either data set in any way you see fit to achieve this goal. 

We would like you to use Python (2 or 3, your choice) or R and you are free to choose any packages/libraries and / or to create user defined functions to complete this task. We would like to get any code you write for this project, and would appreciate if it is at least informally commented so that it’s easier to read for us (preferably, jupyter notebook integrated with R or python). If you could please ouline your approach and outcome in one pager ppt or doc.
